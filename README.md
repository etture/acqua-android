Short for 'acquaintance', *acqua* is a service for managing your acquaintances. Never forget anything about your friends, coworkers, and family again; make memos on *acqua*, and it will remind you of your friends' details right before you meet them. Use the *acqua* calendar for additional functionality like schedule integration with your friends and reminders.
